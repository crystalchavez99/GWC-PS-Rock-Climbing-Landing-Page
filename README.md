Work Prep is intended both to spark student interest in your organization and encourage studentsâ€™ academic and professional growth.

* For the closing ceremony, I chose to do a the HTML & CSS project that aligned with my interest of Web Development
  * Build a Rock Climbing Company Landing Page with HTML & CSS
    * CSS is great for styling a website. In this project, you'll use CSS to style an existing HTML landing page. This page includes several sections which include the header, navigation, hero, sales banner, categories, full banner, and footer.
